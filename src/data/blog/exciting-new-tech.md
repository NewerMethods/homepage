The world of technology is always moving forward. Lately, I've been spending my time with a few new tools and frameworks that I find particularly exciting. From new JavaScript runtimes to advances in AI, there's a lot to be excited about. It's a great time to be a developer, as the tools we use are becoming more powerful and ergonomic.

## New JavaScript Runtimes

Node.js has been the king for a long time, but new contenders like **Deno** and **Bun** are gaining traction. I've been particularly impressed with Bun's focus on speed and its all-in-one toolchain. It acts as a package manager, bundler, and runtime, which simplifies the development workflow significantly. *The performance gains are not just theoretical; you can feel it during development.*

## AI in Development

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are changing how we write code. They can help with boilerplate, suggest solutions, and even help debug complex issues. While they are not a replacement for a solid understanding of fundamentals, they are incredibly powerful assistants that can boost productivity. It's important to learn how to use them effectively.
