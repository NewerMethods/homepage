The web development landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace. As we're well into 2025, several trends are defining how we build and interact with web applications. From performance optimizations to new frameworks, here's what's catching my attention this year.

## Server-Side Renaissance

We're seeing a major shift back to server-side rendering and generation. Frameworks like **Next.js**, **SvelteKit**, and **Nuxt** are leading this charge, offering hybrid approaches that combine the best of both worlds. The performance benefits are undeniable, especially for content-heavy sites.

## Edge Computing Goes Mainstream

Edge computing is no longer just for the big players. Services like Vercel Edge Functions and Cloudflare Workers are making it accessible to everyone. *The ability to run code closer to users is transforming how we think about global applications.*

## Web Assembly's Growing Impact

WebAssembly is finally hitting its stride. We're seeing more languages compile to WASM, and the performance gains for compute-intensive tasks are remarkable. It's particularly exciting for games, image processing, and scientific computing on the web.

## The Component Era

Component-driven development has reached new heights. Design systems are becoming more sophisticated, and tools like **Storybook** and **Figma** are better integrated than ever. The line between design and development continues to blur in the best possible way.

What trends are you most excited about? The future of web development looks incredibly promising.
