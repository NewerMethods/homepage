After years of building APIs and consuming countless others, I've learned that great API design is both an art and a science. It requires balancing technical excellence with developer experience, and the decisions you make early on will impact every interaction with your API.

## Consistency is King

The most important principle is consistency. Whether it's naming conventions, error handling, or response structures, consistency reduces cognitive load for developers using your API. **Pick a standard and stick to it religiously.**

## Error Handling That Actually Helps

Poor error messages are the bane of API consumers. Your errors should be:
- **Descriptive**: Tell them what went wrong
- **Actionable**: Tell them how to fix it
- **Consistent**: Use the same format everywhere

Here's an example of a good error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "field": "email",
    "suggestion": "Please provide a valid email address"
  }
}
```

## Documentation as a First-Class Citizen

Your API is only as good as its documentation. Tools like **OpenAPI/Swagger** make it easier than ever to create interactive documentation. But remember, examples are worth a thousand words. *Show, don't just tell.*

## Rate Limiting and Pagination

From day one, implement proper rate limiting and pagination. Your future self will thank you when your API needs to scale. Be generous with your limits initially, but have the infrastructure in place to adjust as needed.

## Versioning Strategy

Have a versioning strategy before you need one. Whether you choose URL versioning (`/v1/users`) or header-based versioning, be consistent and plan for deprecation cycles.

The best APIs feel intuitive to use. They follow conventions, provide clear feedback, and respect the developer's time. What makes an API great in your experience?
